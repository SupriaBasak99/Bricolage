# Bricolage

Winner of Graduate Capstone Project - WPI:

Project Overview:
Bricolage is a student-designed platform created to address a clear gap in WPI's entrepreneurial ecosystem: the lack of structured support for interdisciplinary team formation. Too often, students' choice of creative collaborators is derived from the randomness of teacher-assigned groups or the proximity of friends and acquaintances. This limits access, alignment, and momentum. Bricolage offers a more intentional approach. MixMatch helps students discover co-founders with complementary skills, work styles, and availability. NeedFeed supports short-term, peer-to-peer project help.
Both tools are informed by user research and designed to reduce friction, build trust, and support venture growth. By centering usability and behavioral alignment, Bricolage moves team formation from chance to choice.
